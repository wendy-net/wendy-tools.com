## Instructions

This theme was built while the Gutenberg Project was still in development. I had to use some custom CSS to achieve the design I wanted. Here's a list with all the CSS classes I made:

* .top-gradient: That gradient at the top of the page.
* .gradient-text: Effect that gives headings the accent color at the beginning and at the end.
* .glass: Glass effect given to the CTA section.
* .neumo: Border given to each testimonial card.
* .ezelian-footer: Border at the top of the footer.

You can go to the style.css and check them or edit them.

## How to Use a Block Theme

### Full Site Editor

In regular themes we had the customizer, whereas in block themes we have the "Edit Site" option. You can start editing your site by clicking on it.

### Patterns

Patterns offer ready-made elements for page design, allowing users to quickly create specific sections or entire layouts without starting from scratch. With patterns, WordPress users can streamline the design of their entire website in the WordPress Site Editor, making the process more efficient.

### Styles

Styles or global styles are a feature that allows the user to quickly change the colors and fonts of the theme to another one. You can check the "styles" folder at the root of the Ezelian theme.

### Template Parts

A template part is often a header, footer, and sidebar. Template parts let you reuse and centralize the styling of an element.
